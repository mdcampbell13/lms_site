This is my proposed project submission for Code Louisville.

The Git repository is located at https://github.com/mdcampbell13/lms_site

It is published on GitHub at https://mdcampbell13.github.io/lms_site/

This project consists of a site for a small business providing audio / video service and equipment rental. The site also is hosted at the domain louisvillemediasolutions.com in an AWS S3 bucket as the endpoint. That code has been minified.

This project was developed using the skills I aquired from the Treehouse front end web development track and other sources and meets the following project submission requirements for Code Louisville:

*Optional Minimal Requirements, Minimum of Three:

-A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)

-Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes

-Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout

-Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button). (zipcode look-up on main page)

-Import Bootstrap from a CDN and use its column system to create a responsive design

-Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through. (on main page)


*Mandatory Requirements:

-Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way

-Your project includes at minimum 3 custom-written CSS elements (selectors, classes, etc) located in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements

-Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file

-Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
